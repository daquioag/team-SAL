Glossary  
Here, you can find some terms commonly used in the world of programming.  
[IDE]  
IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment". An IDE is a software application that allows comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.  


[Commit Message]  
A Commit Message explains to other team members that a certain change has been made for a particular project. For example, if we implemented a "Multiply" Function to a project called Caluclator.Java, a meaningful commit message would be "Add Multiply function to Calculator.Java".  

[Commit]  
The git commit command saves a snapshot of code changes in a project. Committing a block of code saves a revision of that code. Committing also allows team members the ability to revert to any version of that code.  

[Push]  
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing allows contributors to transfer committed code from your local repository to a remote Repository.  

[GitHub]  
GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.  

[Git]  
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to track changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.  

[Java]  
One of the most widely used programming languages, Java is used as the server-side language for most back-end development projects, including those involving big data and Android development. Java is also commonly used for desktop computing, other mobile computing, games, and numerical computing  

[Contributors]  
Team members with the ability to edit a Github Repository.  

[Clone]  
The git clone command is used to copy an existing Git repository into a new local directory. cloning a repository will create a new local directory for that repository, copy all the contents of the specified repository, create the remote tracked branches, and checkout an initial branch locally.  

[Repository]  
A directory or storage space for your projects.
