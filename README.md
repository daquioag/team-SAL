### Overview of IntelliJ IDEA User Guide

Hello reader, our guide on IntelliJ IDEA is meant to guide you through setting up the IDE and and using some of it's features that make coding easier and more collaborative.

The things we want to teach you in this site include how to:
- create a new project in IntelliJ,
- cloning a project from Github using IntelliJ,
- set up version control in IntelliJ using Git,
- share your project on Github, and
- use IntelliJ's Code With Me feature.

### How this guide came to be

Our team has been using IntelliJ to write Java programs for a few months. Although we are now comfortable using IntelliJ for coding daily, we all remember the learning curve we had to go through to get started with IntelliJ's many features and menus. We decided to cover how to get set up with IntelliJ and use some of its most useful features in this guide. 

To write this guide, we brainstormed as a group and picked a few tasks that a new user needs to complete to start coding in the IntelliJ environment. We also included some quality-of-life features that can give developers who are using IntelliJ a competitive advantage. We hope you find this guide useful and that this guide gets you started in your coding journey using IntelliJ.


### How We Created Our Guide
To write this user guide, we had to learn how to use new technologies and deepen our understanding of those we already had worked with. To accomplish this, we used online resources such as tutorials and looked at examples of user guides written before.

#### Using Markdown

We had all used markdown to write simple readme files for our assignment before. However, none of us were aware of markdown's full potential when formatting text documents.

To write this user guide, we learned how to use markdown to organize information using sections, different levels of headings, lists, and font formats such as italics. We also learned how to use links in our markdown to include images, shortcuts to other segments of our guide, or external links. This increased the overall quality of the documentation and made it more interactive.


#### Using Gitub Pages

We used Github Pages to host this user guide directly from our Github repository. Through this process, we learned about many features of Github that we had never used before.

To generate this repo, we used a template named just-the-docs that was made specifically for making documentation. We made a copy of this templating by "forking" its repository. This gave us an identical version of the template that we could modify for our user guide without affecting the original.

We then used the Pages feature on Github to host our user guide online. We had to go through a learning curve while using this feature as we had to learn the file structure of the repository and how modifying different files will affect the final result on our hosted page.


#### Making our guide reader-centred

To make our guide more readable, we split the information into small sections that are easily digestible for the user. This practice is referred to as chunking. We also used a numbering system to make our guide easy to follow. In this system, numbers are given to each action that must be accomplished to complete a task.

Additionally, we used images for every step of the instructions. To be thorough, we included a picture for every possible scenario that the reader might encounter while following our instructions. We used red rectangles in our images to draw the reader's attention to the crucial parts of the picture.

Finally, we used icons to divert the reader's attention to important information that could otherwise be easily missed. To accomplish this, we used ```⚠️ WARNING``` and ```⚠️ ATTENTION``` tags throughout our guide.

#### Assuing that the guide works

While following a user manual, many things can go wrong for the reader that the authors had not predicted. We took several measures to ensure that our guide would work as intended.

First, we created our instructions by using a clean install of IntelliJ. This way, we ensured that none of the modifications we had made to our version of IntelliJ affected our instructions.

Additionally, we had a group of testers use our instructions to produce the desired outcome. This way, we would know if there was an oversight while making the instructions.

Finally, we informed the reader of the version of the program we are using and any setup they need to do before reading our instructions.


### Conclusion
Writing a user guide proved to be more intricate than any of us had foreseen. However, we were able to accomplish it by paying close attention to detail and helping each other along the process. We learned a great deal about proper documentation and writing reader-friendly instructions through this project.

We hope that what we created here can help future developers set up their working environment and get the most out of their IDE.  
Thank you for reading our IntelliJ IDEA User Guide.
